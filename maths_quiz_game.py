'''
This program will:
Generate equation with random numbers, such as, 3 x ùë• = 12.
Use Tkinter to create a GUI for the quiz.
Check if the user‚Äôs answer is correct and display an appropriate message.
Repeat the process for five equations, keeping track of the user‚Äôs score.
Output the total score after all questions have been answered.
