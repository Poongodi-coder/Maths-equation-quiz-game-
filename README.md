# Maths Equation Quiz Game

## User Manual

### Introduction
Welcome to the Maths equation quiz game! This program will test your math skills by generating random equations for you to solve. You will be presented with five equations, and your task is to solve them correctly. At the end of the quiz, your total score will be displayed.

### How to Use the Program

1. **Starting the Quiz**:
   - When you run the program, a series of pop-up windows will appear, each displaying a math equation.
   - You need to solve the equation and enter your answer in the provided input box.

2. **Answering Questions**:
   - Each equation will be in the form of `a * x = b`, where `a` and `b` are random numbers.
   - You need to find the value of `x` that satisfies the equation and enter it in the input box.

3. **Feedback**:
   - After you submit your answer, a message will appear indicating whether your answer was correct or incorrect.
   - Your score will be updated based on your answers.

4. **Completing the Quiz**:
   - The quiz consists of five questions.
   - After answering all questions, a final message will display your total score out of five.

### Example
- You might see an equation like `3 * x = 12`.
- To solve it, you would calculate `x = 12 / 3`, so `x = 4`.
- Enter `4` in the input box and submit your answer.

### Requirements
- Download Python: If you don‚Äôt have Python installed, download it from [official Python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Download VSC: A code editor. If you don‚Äôt have VSC installed, download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You also need the `tkinter` library, which is included in Python installations.

### Running the Program
- The program requires Python and Visual Studio Code to be installed on your computer.
- Save the two program files in a folder and name the module file as `simple_equation_quiz.py` and the main file as `maths_quiz_game.py`.
- In VSCode, you can usually run the program by clicking the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button or pressing the `F5` function key on your keyboard.
